## Features

- Realistic representation of a crossing with traffic lights.
- Traffic lights for North-South and East-West directions.
- Pedestrian signal to stop traffic for pedestrians to cross safely.
- Manual control to change the traffic light signals.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- The traffic lights will initially start with the North-South direction having a green light, and the East-West direction having a red light.
- To simulate a traffic light change, click the "Change Lights" button, and the lights will cycle from green to yellow to red and back again for both directions.
- To activate the pedestrian signal, click the "Pedestrian Signal" button. This will turn on the red lights for all directions, allowing pedestrians to cross safely.
- Click the "Pedestrian Signal" button again to turn off the pedestrian signal and resume normal traffic flow.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Enhancements

- Add sound effects to mimic real traffic lights.
- Implement timers to automatically change traffic light signals at specific intervals.
- Improve the visual design for a more realistic and interactive experience.
